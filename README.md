DICOM Image download automation

You'll need to install IEDriverServer.exe(see selenium docs) and place 
it in the ***Scripts*** folder in you virtual environment.

I've put a file on my G drive ***G:\dicom\.env*** to automate the login.
The program mush be able to open the log file (results.csv). If you are 
viewing the file open as read only.
